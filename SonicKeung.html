            <p>Sonic was born in Vancouver, BC, and likes hedgehogs....
                In addition to Badminton and automotives, he likes working with computers. This is why he joined the Computing Department
                at BCIT where he also hopes to become competent in programming languages. The area in Computing that Sonic wants to succeed is
                the Java course. Needless to say, Sonic's favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
