            <p>Although Jonah was born in Saint John's, NL, he has spent most his life in the city of Vancouver, BC. </p>
			<p>Jonah has a strong passion for music, and was going to do a dual degree with a Science Major and Performance Major before a debilitating injury ruined his dream. </p>
			<p>
				His free time is now spent teaching guitar, boudering, and training his dog to potentially be his service animal.
				He has gone into the Computer Department at BCIT since he is incredibly interested in Big Data, AI and it's ethics, and Cryptology.
