            <p>Loretta was born and raised in Vancouver, BC in a family of four. She grew up loving sports and art as her hobbies but after some twists and turns, her academic career eventually led her to the tech field. The diversity of the industry is a huge appeal to Loretta and she hopes to be able to pursue a fulfilling career within the area of technology. In Loretta's free time outside of her studies, she enjoys indoor rock climbing and is a frequent visitor at the Hive bouldering gym.
