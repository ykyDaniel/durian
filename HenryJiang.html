            <p>Henry was born in Richmond, BC, and is still living there today. His interest in
			computers started in grade 2, when he would discover his first online game.
			Although he did not learn any programming until after highschool, he finds programming
			fun and challenging. He's also not sure which field to specialize in, but is leaning towards
			game development or web design.</p>
