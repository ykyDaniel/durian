            <p>Nirajan was born on base camp 1, Mount Everest, Nepal. That was a lie, he was born in Nepal
			 but has never has the opportunity to ski down the slopes of the Himalayas, just trek. Aside from all the
			 heroic  sports he plays, he is also an aspiring programmer, with his main interest being in mobile apps.
			 Needless to say, Nirajan's <b>Favourite</b> course is COMP 1111 <i>(Of course)</i>.
