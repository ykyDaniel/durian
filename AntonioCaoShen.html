				Hello Everyone! I am Antonio. I was born in a country in 
				South America, Peru. I went to China and lived there for 
				10 years after the age of three months. I finally came to
				Canada when i was 10 years old. Now, i just recently turned
				17 and just graduated from high school. The reason why i decided 
				to come to BCIT was because i didn't like the electives that other
				university forces me to take. On the same time, i know BCIT is going
				to be hard, but i strongly believe that we can get through all the
				coming challenges as a team. </p>
