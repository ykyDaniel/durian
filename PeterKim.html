            <p>Peter has lived in Vancouver for 8 years before he decided to go to Hamilton, Ontario
			   to work on his undergraduate degree. He regrets that decision and has joined BCIT to learn
			   and start a career in the field of computer science. He is very interested in all the courses
			   and all the things CST offers, and Peter's favorite course is definitely COMP1111.</p>
